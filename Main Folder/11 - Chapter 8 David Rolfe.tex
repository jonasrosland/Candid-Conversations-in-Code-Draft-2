Before David Rolfe, arcade video games did not have high score tables, console video games did not have programming backbones, and sports games ddin’t resemble the real thing. In the course of three exciting years, that all changed as rapid advancements in the way video games were made started to put to bed the endless “from scratch” methods of the earliest pioneers.

By his own admission, Rolfe was a tool-builder, not a lover of games who would obsess over the latest releases. Even without that though, his mind worked in ways which sprang innovation out of the confused mess of late 1970s game design. His works like Star Fire and the Intellivision Exec operating system each in their own way stated a future for what video games could become. David explains his humble origins as an intern creating a single game over the course of two years to the indispensable man in Mattel’s foray in video games.
