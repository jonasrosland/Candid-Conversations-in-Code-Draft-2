Talented programmers may sometimes be difficult to appreciate the true legacy of, as their work fits into a collective of steady developments in technology. Only a few sit at the true epoch, and Mark Lesser is one of them. You have him to thank for the still vibrant market of electronic handheld games which he first pioneered with Mattel Electronics’ Auto Race and Football. Likewise, he built the successful NHL series for Electronic Arts, providing a new level of fidelity to a vibrant series of sports titles into the future.

Between these two grand accomplishments were also a great number of smaller but extremely interesting developments in Mr. Lesser’s career. Let this chat inform you of how he became one of the most adept programmers on the Sega Genesis, how he created the first handheld game with the most paltry amount of memory possible, and how the solo-programmer effort eventually gave way to larger AAA production.
