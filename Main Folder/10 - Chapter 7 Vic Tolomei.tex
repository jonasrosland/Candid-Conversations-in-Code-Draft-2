The career of Vic Tolomei is as vibrant and interesting as any you’re likely to find in the early days of video games. Tolomei was proactive in seeking out gaming experiences of all kinds, following a trail from co-creating mainframe games with his Dungeons \& Dragons-loving friends to becoming an extremely early adopter of the Apple II for both serious and recreational reasons.

Vic became acutely interested in programming for the Sorceror computer, a micro released by the arcade company Exidy in Sunnyvale, California. Exidy was renowned for their off-beat, semi-successful releases like Death Race and Circus, having created the Sorceror computer as part of their move into microprocessor game development. From his early support of the platform, Tolomei became an intimate to the folks in Sunnyvale and eventually joined them as an arcade video game designer for games such as Venture and Crossbow.

Vic tells the tales of how he was involved in one of the first personal computer RPGs, his obssessions with programming as well as teaching others, and why Exidy didn’t become Apple.
